# Prabhat Lankireddy

I am a Masters ([M.S. by Research](https://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/msResearch.jsp)) student in the [Center for Machine Intelligence and Data Science (C-MInDS)](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/) at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, guided by Prof. D. Manjunath. My research interests broadly lie in machine learning theory. I obtained my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati.

## Research

I am currently working on understanding how online learning algorithms, particularly recommendation systems, can affect their users. A standard assumption made by such algorithms is that the distribution of data they are learning is stationary, and that assumption breaks down in many real world scenarios. For instance, recommendation systems try to learn preferences of their users using feedback received from them, but they effect the user preferences in the process. Understanding the unintended consequences of this mismatch between the algorithmsâ€™ assumptions and reality is key to developing better algorithms.

In the past, I worked on developing deep learning solutions to problems in medical imaging. Another line of work is on the variants of the Lambert W function and its applications in physics.
